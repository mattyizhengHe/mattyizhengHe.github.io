#### Some of my notes
[MATH240 Discrete Structure](/assets/pdf/MATH240_Discrete_Structure.pdf)
A complete note of material covered in the first course in discrete mathematics. \\
<a href='https://github.com/mattyizhengHe/Math-Cs-Notes/blob/Master/MATH323_Probability(Extended)/MATH323_Probability(Extended).pdf'> MATH323 Probablity (Extended) </a> Probability notes, extended from material that usually covered in MATH323 to bridge the gap between between MATH323 and some advanced courses. (Not fully finished yet...) 

#### Random stuffs

<a href='https://github.com/mattyizhengHe/Customized-TufteHandout-Latex'> Customized Tufte Handout Latex</a> The Latex template I used.
