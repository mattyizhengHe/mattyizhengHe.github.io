I'm an undergraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, where I learn things about neuroscience, applied mathematics, and computer science. I've been working wih <a href='https://mila.quebec/en/directory/paul-masset'>Dr. Paul Masset</a> on compressed sensing models of olfactory sensation since Fall 2024.

I'm interested in theoretical and computational neuroscience, machine learning theory, and applied mathematicsâ€”particularly in the computational principles and implementations that underlie intellectual processes, from sensing and learning to decision-making, in both artificial and biological systems.

You can find some of my notes, a collection of resources I found useful,
and some random stuffs on this website.
