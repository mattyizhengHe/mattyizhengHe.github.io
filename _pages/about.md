I'm an undergraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, where I learn about neuroscience, applied mathematics, and computer science. I've been working with <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/chenjiang01'>Chen Jiang</a>, <a href='https://jzv.io'>Jacob Zavatone-Veth</a> and <a href='https://mila.quebec/en/directory/paul-masset'>Paul Masset</a> on compressed sensing models of olfactory sensation since Fall 2024.

I'm interested in theoretical and computational neuroscience, machine learning theory, and applied mathematicsâ€”particularly in the computational principles and implementations that underlie intellectual processes, in both artificial and biological systems.

You can find some of my notes, a collection of resources I found useful,
and some random stuffs on this website.

    My current research focuses on olfactory sensation models using compressed sensing techniques. I'm exploring how biological systems efficiently encode and process sensory information with limited neural resources.
    
    Other research interests include:
    - Computational models of neural circuits
    - Information theory applications in neuroscience
    - Machine learning for biological data analysis
